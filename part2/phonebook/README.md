## 2.6: The Phonebook Step1

Let us start by implementing the addition of a person to phonebook.

## 2.7: The Phonebook Step2

Issue a warning with the alert command when such an action is attempted

## 2.8: The Phonebook Step3
Expand your application by allowing users to add phone numbers to the phone book.

## 2.9*: The Phonebook Step4
Implement a search field that can be used to filter the list of people by name

## 2.10: The Phonebook Step5
If you have implemented your application in a single component, refactor it by extracting suitable parts into new components. Maintain the application's state and all event handlers in the App root component.

It is sufficient to extract three components from the application. Good candidates for separate components are, for example, the search filter, the form for adding new people into the phonebook, a component that renders all people from the phonebook, and a component that renders a single person's details.
